# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: Eclipse OBD-II Tech Debt and Improvements
# Branch: ralph/tech-debt-cleanup
# Started: 2026-01-26

## Codebase Patterns
- ConfigValidator uses dot-notation for nested key access (e.g., 'database.server')
- Default values are defined in module-level DEFAULTS dict
- Custom exceptions should include typed field lists for clear debugging
- All modules in src/common/ follow camelCase for functions, PascalCase for classes
- Test files use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) with descriptive docstrings
- Use relative imports within subpackages (e.g., `from .types import ...`)
- Use absolute imports across subpackages (e.g., `from src.obd.data.types import ...`)
- Types modules should have no dependencies on other project modules
- Consider using `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints to avoid runtime circular imports

## Session Log

## 2026-01-26 - US-TD-001
User Story: Fix Error Classification Documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md:
  - Changed "4-tier classification" to "5-tier classification" (line 97)
  - Added missing Authentication error type between Retryable and Configuration
  - Renumbered error types 3-5 (Configuration, Data, System)
  - Updated reference on line 228 from "4-tier" to "5-tier"
- Files changed: CLAUDE.md, ralph/ralph_agents.json
- **Verification:**
  - specs/architecture.md already had correct 5-tier documentation (lines 208-227)
  - specs/methodology.md already had correct 5-tier documentation (lines 319-325)
  - src/common/error_handler.py implementation confirmed 5 error types: RETRYABLE, AUTHENTICATION, CONFIGURATION, DATA, SYSTEM
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CLAUDE.md is a developer reference that should match implementation details
  - When checking documentation consistency, verify the actual code first to understand the ground truth
  - Both specs/architecture.md and specs/methodology.md are generally more up-to-date than CLAUDE.md

## 2026-01-26 - US-TD-002
User Story: Update Raspberry Pi Target Documentation
- Updated specs/architecture.md Hardware section (lines 88-95):
  - Changed Processor from "Raspberry Pi 3B+/4" to "Raspberry Pi 5 Model B" with "8GB RAM for AI inference"
  - Added Storage: "128GB A2 U3/V30 microSD" with "High-endurance recommended"
  - Changed Display from "Adafruit 1.3\" TFT" to "OSOYOO 3.5\" HDMI Touch" (480x320)
  - Renamed Storage row to Database (SQLite remained same)
  - Changed Power from "12V to 5V adapter" to "Geekworm X1209 UPS HAT" with "18650 battery backup"
  - Changed Monitoring from "ADC/I2C" to "I2C" with "Battery voltage/current via UPS telemetry"
- Files changed: specs/architecture.md, ralph/ralph_agents.json, ralph/prd.json
- **Verification:**
  - docs/hardware-reference.md already had correct Pi 5 (8GB) and 128GB microSD specs
  - specs/samples/piSpecs.md already had correct Pi 5 specs
  - CLAUDE.md has no Raspberry Pi version references
  - All 1013 tests pass
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - docs/hardware-reference.md is the canonical hardware reference - architecture.md should match it
  - The OSOYOO 3.5" display replaced the older Adafruit 1.3" TFT concept
  - Geekworm X1209 UPS HAT is the production UPS solution with I2C telemetry
