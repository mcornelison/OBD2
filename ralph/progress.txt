## Codebase Patterns
- ConfigValidator uses dot-notation for nested key access (e.g., 'database.server')
- Default values are defined in module-level DEFAULTS dict
- Custom exceptions should include typed field lists for clear debugging
- All modules in src/common/ follow camelCase for functions, PascalCase for classes
- Test files use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) with descriptive docstrings
- Use relative imports within subpackages (e.g., `from .types import ...`)
- Use absolute imports across subpackages (e.g., `from src.obd.data.types import ...`)
- Types modules should have no dependencies on other project modules
- Consider using `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints to avoid runtime circular imports
- PM communication: blockers -> pm/blockers/, tech debt -> pm/techDebt/, issues -> pm/issues/
- specs/ is read-only for Ralph; request PM for spec changes
- Git branching: use sprint branches, merge to main when sprint is done
