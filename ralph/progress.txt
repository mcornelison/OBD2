## Codebase Patterns
- ConfigValidator uses dot-notation for nested key access (e.g., 'database.server')
- Default values are defined in module-level DEFAULTS dict
- Custom exceptions should include typed field lists for clear debugging
- All modules in src/common/ follow camelCase for functions, PascalCase for classes
- Test files use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) with descriptive docstrings
- Use relative imports within subpackages (e.g., `from .types import ...`)
- Use absolute imports across subpackages (e.g., `from src.obd.data.types import ...`)
- Types modules should have no dependencies on other project modules
- Consider using `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints to avoid runtime circular imports

## Session Log

## 2026-01-26 - US-TD-001
User Story: Fix Error Classification Documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md:
  - Changed "4-tier classification" to "5-tier classification" (line 97)
  - Added missing Authentication error type between Retryable and Configuration
  - Renumbered error types 3-5 (Configuration, Data, System)
  - Updated reference on line 228 from "4-tier" to "5-tier"
- Files changed: CLAUDE.md, ralph/ralph_agents.json
- **Verification:**
  - specs/architecture.md already had correct 5-tier documentation (lines 208-227)
  - specs/methodology.md already had correct 5-tier documentation (lines 319-325)
  - src/common/error_handler.py implementation confirmed 5 error types: RETRYABLE, AUTHENTICATION, CONFIGURATION, DATA, SYSTEM
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CLAUDE.md is a developer reference that should match implementation details
  - When checking documentation consistency, verify the actual code first to understand the ground truth
  - Both specs/architecture.md and specs/methodology.md are generally more up-to-date than CLAUDE.md
