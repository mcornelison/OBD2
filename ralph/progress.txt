# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: Eclipse OBD-II Raspberry Pi Hardware Integration
# Branch: ralph/rpi-hardware-integration
# Started: 2026-01-25

## Codebase Patterns
- ConfigValidator uses dot-notation for nested key access (e.g., 'database.server')
- Default values are defined in module-level DEFAULTS dict
- Custom exceptions should include typed field lists for clear debugging
- All modules in src/common/ follow camelCase for functions, PascalCase for classes
- Test files use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) with descriptive docstrings
- Use relative imports within subpackages (e.g., `from .types import ...`)
- Use absolute imports across subpackages (e.g., `from src.obd.data.types import ...`)
- Types modules should have no dependencies on other project modules
- Consider using `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints to avoid runtime circular imports
- Preserve all docstrings and type hints during moves
- Package/module name collision: When foo/ package shadows foo.py module, use importlib.util
- When refactoring modules, test patches must be updated to reference the new module location
- Re-export facades maintain backward compatibility during subpackage refactoring

## Session Log

## 2026-01-25 - US-RPI-001
User Story: Create Hardware Reference Documentation
- Created docs/hardware-reference.md with comprehensive hardware specifications
- Documented Raspberry Pi 5 specs (8GB, ARM64, key interfaces)
- Documented Geekworm X1209 UPS HAT specs (5.1V/5A output, 18650 battery, I2C telemetry)
- Added I2C configuration section (bus 1, addresses 0x36/0x57)
- Documented telemetry data points with register addresses (voltage, current, percentage, power source)
- Added GPIO pin assignments (GPIO17 for shutdown button, GPIO27 for status LED)
- Documented OSOYOO 3.5" HDMI capacitive touch display (480x320, USB touch)
- Created text-based wiring diagram showing all connections
- Added platform-specific code path guidance for Windows vs Pi development
- Referenced specs/samples/piSpecs.md for detailed specifications
- All 609 tests pass
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - I2C on Pi uses bus 1 by default (/dev/i2c-1)
  - X1209 can use address 0x36 or 0x57 depending on variant
  - GPIO17/27 are commonly used for button/LED as they're easily accessible
  - Use smbus2 for I2C, gpiozero for GPIO (simpler than RPi.GPIO)
  - Design display UI for 480x320 with large touch targets (60x60px min)
