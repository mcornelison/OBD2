# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- ConfigValidator uses dot-notation for nested key access (e.g., 'database.server')
- Default values are defined in module-level DEFAULTS dict
- Custom exceptions should include typed field lists for clear debugging
- All modules in src/common/ follow camelCase for functions, PascalCase for classes
- Test files use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) with descriptive docstrings
- Use relative imports within subpackages (e.g., `from .types import ...`)
- Use absolute imports across subpackages (e.g., `from src.obd.data.types import ...`)
- Types modules should have no dependencies on other project modules
- Consider using `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints to avoid runtime circular imports

## Coding Rules (Mandatory)
1. **Write reusable code** - Extract common logic into shared utilities; check existing helpers before writing new ones
2. **Keep files small** - ~300 lines for source, ~500 lines for tests; split when exceeding
3. **Organize by functionality and module** - Group into packages with types.py, exceptions.py, core, helpers.py, __init__.py

## Working Rules
- PM communication: blockers -> pm/blockers/, tech debt -> pm/techDebt/, issues -> pm/issues/
- specs/ is **read-only** for Ralph; request PM for spec changes via pm/issues/
- pm/backlog/ is **PM-only**; Ralph does not write there
- Git branching: use sprint branches (e.g., sprint/2026-02-sprint1), merge to master when sprint is done
- Never push directly to master during active sprint work
- Single config file: src/obd_config.json (SQLite, Eclipse OBD-II project)
- Single requirements file: requirements.txt (includes dev tools); Pi-specific in requirements-pi.txt

## Project Structure Knowledge
- src/common/ - Foundation utilities (config_validator, secrets_loader, logging_config, error_handler)
- src/obd/ - OBD-II domain (orchestrator, connection, database, data, drive, vehicle, simulator, etc.)
- src/ai/ - AI analysis (analyzer, ollama manager)
- src/backup/ - Backup system (backup_manager, google_drive uploader)
- src/hardware/ - Raspberry Pi hardware (HardwareManager, UpsMonitor, ShutdownHandler, GpioButton, StatusDisplay)
- src/display/ - Display rendering (drivers/, adapters/)
- src/power/ - Power monitoring
- src/alert/ - Alert management
- src/analysis/ - Statistical analysis
- src/calibration/ - Calibration sessions
- src/profile/ - Profile management
- tests/ - Flat structure, all test_*.py files (no subdirectories for integration/e2e yet)
- pm/ - Project management (backlog, PRDs, issues, blockers, techDebt, roadmap)
- specs/ - Developer reference (standards, architecture, methodology, anti-patterns, glossary) - READ ONLY
- ralph/ - Agent system (agent.md, prd.json, progress.txt, ralph_agents.json, archive/)

## Known Tech Debt (filed as TD-001)
- orchestrator.py is 2,500 lines (CRITICAL - needs splitting)
- test_orchestrator.py is 7,516 lines (CRITICAL - needs splitting)
- 11 source files over 500 lines
- 3 empty placeholder packages: src/obd/export/, src/obd/shutdown/, src/obd/service/
- TestDataManager in test_utils.py has __init__ causing pytest warning
- obd_config.json has display 240x240 (should be 480x320) and realtimeDataDays 7 (should be 365)

## Orchestrator Deep Dive (2026-01-29)

### Structure: 2,500 lines, 1 god class, 70+ methods, 40+ instance vars, 12 component dependencies
### Supporting: ShutdownState enum, HealthCheckStats dataclass, 4 exception classes, 1 factory function

### 12 Responsibility Areas
1. Lifecycle (init/start/stop) - 500 lines
2. Signal handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM, double-Ctrl+C) - 100 lines
3. Main event loop (100ms tick, health checks) - 100 lines
4. Event routing (callbacks for readings, drives, alerts, analysis, profiles) - 400 lines
5. Connection recovery (exponential backoff, pause/resume data logger) - 350 lines
6. Health monitoring (stats, data rate, uptime) - 200 lines
7. Status reporting (component status, backup status) - 130 lines
8. Display updates (distributed across callbacks)
9. VIN decoding (first-connection query, NHTSA API) - 120 lines
10. Backup management (init, catchup, schedule, upload, cleanup) - 300 lines
11. Hardware integration (Pi-only, UPS, GPIO) - distributed
12. Config extraction (timeouts, intervals, parameters) - 90 lines

### Component Init Order (dependency chain)
Database -> ProfileManager -> Connection -> VinDecoder -> DisplayManager -> HardwareManager -> StatisticsEngine -> DriveDetector -> AlertManager -> DataLogger -> ProfileSwitcher -> BackupManager

### Shutdown Order (reverse)
BackupManager -> DataLogger -> AlertManager -> DriveDetector -> StatisticsEngine -> HardwareManager -> DisplayManager -> VinDecoder -> Connection -> ProfileSwitcher -> ProfileManager -> Database

### Data Flow
Reading: DataLogger -> Orchestrator._handleReading -> DisplayManager + DriveDetector + AlertManager
Drive: DriveDetector -> Orchestrator._handleDriveStart/End -> DisplayManager + external callback
Alert: AlertManager -> Orchestrator._handleAlert -> DisplayManager + HardwareManager + external
Analysis: StatisticsEngine -> Orchestrator._handleAnalysisComplete -> DisplayManager + external
Profile: ProfileSwitcher -> Orchestrator._handleProfileChange -> AlertManager + DataLogger

### Proposed 7-Module Split
- types.py (~100 lines): ShutdownState, HealthCheckStats, exceptions, constants
- core.py (~750 lines): ApplicationOrchestrator class, __init__, properties, getStatus, runLoop
- lifecycle.py (~400 lines): All _initialize*() and _shutdown*() methods
- connection_recovery.py (~350 lines): Reconnection logic, pause/resume
- event_router.py (~400 lines): Callback registration and all _handle*() methods
- backup_coordinator.py (~300 lines): Backup init, scheduling, upload
- health_monitor.py (~200 lines): Health checks, stats, data rate
- signal_handler.py (~100 lines): SIGINT/SIGTERM handling

### Good Patterns Found
- Graceful fallbacks (HARDWARE_AVAILABLE, BACKUP_AVAILABLE flags)
- Dependency-ordered init, reverse-order shutdown
- Timeout-based shutdown with force-exit
- Exponential backoff for reconnection
- Double-Ctrl+C pattern (graceful then force)
- Non-critical errors logged as warnings, don't crash

### Concerning Patterns Found
- God class (2,500 lines, 12 deps, 40+ vars, 70+ methods)
- Component types are Optional[Any] - loses type safety
- 30+ hasattr() calls for duck typing instead of protocols/ABCs
- Threading without full coordination (daemon flag relied on)
- Callback chains hard to trace (reading triggers 4 handlers)
- Some magic numbers inline (0.1 sleep interval)

## Lessons Learned
- When changing config defaults (like main.py --config default), always check for test assertions on that value
- Config files accumulate drift: the generic template (src/config.json) and the actual project config (obd_config.json) diverged completely - only keep one
- requirements-dev.txt with `-r requirements.txt` creates duplication headaches - single file is simpler
- Dead code detection: if a file references deleted files (run_all_tests.py -> run_tests_*.py), it's dead too
- Windows 8.3 short filenames (NDH6SA~M) can get accidentally committed - check for garbage files
- Specs drift from code faster than expected: 7 drift items found across 5 spec files after just a few weeks
- Always run full test suite before committing housekeeping changes
- When archiving completed PRDs, copy both prd.json AND progress.txt to preserve context
- Agent state (ralph_agents.json) gets stale - clear completed task IDs during housekeeping

## 2026-01-31 - US-DEP-001
User Story: Create Deploy Configuration File
- Created deploy/deploy.conf.example with PI_HOST, PI_USER, PI_PATH, PI_PORT variables
- Added deploy/deploy.conf to .gitignore (Project Specific section)
- Copied deploy.conf.example to deploy.conf as working copy
- All 1133 tests pass, no Python source changes so typecheck unaffected
- Files changed: deploy/deploy.conf.example (new), .gitignore (updated), ralph/stories.json, ralph/ralph_agents.json, ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - deploy/ directory already has install-service.sh, uninstall-service.sh, eclipse-obd.service from previous Pi setup work
  - Shell script headers in this project use two styles: pi_setup.sh uses the full `################################################################################` style, install-service.sh uses `# ==============================================================================` style - both are acceptable
  - System python (Windows Store) doesn't have dev tools (mypy, ruff) - must use .venv python or `python -m pytest` which resolves via PATH
  - The venv pytest works via `cd project && python -m pytest tests/` but direct `.venv/Scripts/python` calls may require approval
