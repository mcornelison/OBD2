# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: Eclipse OBD-II Tech Debt and Improvements
# Branch: ralph/tech-debt-cleanup
# Started: 2026-01-26

## Codebase Patterns
- ConfigValidator uses dot-notation for nested key access (e.g., 'database.server')
- Default values are defined in module-level DEFAULTS dict
- Custom exceptions should include typed field lists for clear debugging
- All modules in src/common/ follow camelCase for functions, PascalCase for classes
- Test files use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) with descriptive docstrings
- Use relative imports within subpackages (e.g., `from .types import ...`)
- Use absolute imports across subpackages (e.g., `from src.obd.data.types import ...`)
- Types modules should have no dependencies on other project modules
- Consider using `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints to avoid runtime circular imports

## Session Log

## 2026-01-26 - US-TD-001
User Story: Fix Error Classification Documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md:
  - Changed "4-tier classification" to "5-tier classification" (line 97)
  - Added missing Authentication error type between Retryable and Configuration
  - Renumbered error types 3-5 (Configuration, Data, System)
  - Updated reference on line 228 from "4-tier" to "5-tier"
- Files changed: CLAUDE.md, ralph/ralph_agents.json
- **Verification:**
  - specs/architecture.md already had correct 5-tier documentation (lines 208-227)
  - specs/methodology.md already had correct 5-tier documentation (lines 319-325)
  - src/common/error_handler.py implementation confirmed 5 error types: RETRYABLE, AUTHENTICATION, CONFIGURATION, DATA, SYSTEM
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - CLAUDE.md is a developer reference that should match implementation details
  - When checking documentation consistency, verify the actual code first to understand the ground truth
  - Both specs/architecture.md and specs/methodology.md are generally more up-to-date than CLAUDE.md

## 2026-01-26 - US-TD-002
User Story: Update Raspberry Pi Target Documentation
- Updated specs/architecture.md Hardware section (lines 88-95):
  - Changed Processor from "Raspberry Pi 3B+/4" to "Raspberry Pi 5 Model B" with "8GB RAM for AI inference"
  - Added Storage: "128GB A2 U3/V30 microSD" with "High-endurance recommended"
  - Changed Display from "Adafruit 1.3\" TFT" to "OSOYOO 3.5\" HDMI Touch" (480x320)
  - Renamed Storage row to Database (SQLite remained same)
  - Changed Power from "12V to 5V adapter" to "Geekworm X1209 UPS HAT" with "18650 battery backup"
  - Changed Monitoring from "ADC/I2C" to "I2C" with "Battery voltage/current via UPS telemetry"
- Files changed: specs/architecture.md, ralph/ralph_agents.json, ralph/prd.json
- **Verification:**
  - docs/hardware-reference.md already had correct Pi 5 (8GB) and 128GB microSD specs
  - specs/samples/piSpecs.md already had correct Pi 5 specs
  - CLAUDE.md has no Raspberry Pi version references
  - All 1013 tests pass
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - docs/hardware-reference.md is the canonical hardware reference - architecture.md should match it
  - The OSOYOO 3.5" display replaced the older Adafruit 1.3" TFT concept
  - Geekworm X1209 UPS HAT is the production UPS solution with I2C telemetry

## 2026-01-26 - US-TD-003
User Story: Update Data Retention to 1 Year
- Updated realtime_data retention from 7 days to 365 days (1 year)
- Files changed:
  - specs/architecture.md (line 285): "7 days" → "365 days"
  - specs/samples/piSpecs.md (line 135): "7 days or 100MB max" → "365 days"
  - src/common/config_validator.py: Added 'database.retentionDays': 365 to DEFAULTS
  - src/obd/config/loader.py: Updated 'dataRetention.realtimeDataDays' from 7 to 365
  - src/obd/obd_config_loader.py: Updated 'dataRetention.realtimeDataDays' from 7 to 365
  - src/obd/data_retention.py: Updated default values from 7 to 365 in CleanupResult dataclass, DataRetentionManager init, and runImmediateCleanup function
- **Verification:**
  - Data cleanup code (data_retention.py) already reads retention from config via retentionConfig.get('realtimeDataDays')
  - All 1013 tests pass
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Retention defaults are defined in multiple places: config_validator.py (global), obd_config_loader.py (OBD-specific), and data_retention.py (fallback)
  - When changing defaults, update all locations for consistency
  - data_retention.py has CleanupResult dataclass and runImmediateCleanup function with hardcoded defaults that also need updating

## 2026-01-26 - US-TD-004
User Story: Document Ollama Fallback Behavior
- Reviewed src/ai/analyzer.py and src/ai/ollama.py for graceful degradation behavior
- The AI subsystem already implements excellent graceful degradation:
  - analyzer.py line 271-274: When disabled, logs at `debug` level and returns result with error message
  - analyzer.py line 352-355: When not available, logs at `warning` level and returns result gracefully
  - ollama.py line 146-150: OllamaManager logs warning if enabled but unavailable, continues operation
  - Functions return safe defaults (empty lists, False, None) rather than throwing exceptions
- Documentation added:
  - specs/architecture.md: Added "AI Graceful Degradation" note to Analysis Flow section (line 208)
  - ralph/agent.md: Added "Graceful degradation when ollama unavailable" section in Ollama/AI Integration
- Files changed: specs/architecture.md, ralph/agent.md, ralph/ralph_agents.json, ralph/prd.json
- **Verification:**
  - All 1013 tests pass
  - Python syntax compilation passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The AI subsystem uses appropriate log levels: `debug` for expected skips (disabled), `warning` for unexpected unavailability
  - Graceful degradation pattern: return results with error messages rather than throwing exceptions
  - Always check both the analyzer (consumer) and manager (provider) when documenting fallback behavior
  - Post-drive workflow continues successfully even when AI unavailable - statistics are still calculated

## 2026-01-26 - US-TD-005
User Story: Evaluate and Enable Development Dependencies
- Uncommented black>=23.0.0, ruff>=0.1.0, mypy>=1.0.0 in requirements.txt
- Created requirements-dev.txt with dev-only packages:
  - Includes `-r requirements.txt` for base dependencies
  - Adds black, ruff, mypy, types-setuptools
- Updated Makefile install-dev target to use `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
- Added explanatory comments for optional packages in requirements.txt:
  - Database section: explains pyodbc for SQL Server, sqlalchemy for ORM
  - API/HTTP section: explains requests vs httpx for sync/async
  - Data Processing section: explains pandas for DataFrames, numpy for math
  - Logging section: explains structlog for JSON-formatted logs
- Files changed: requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt (new), Makefile, ralph/ralph_agents.json
- **Verification:**
  - All 1013 tests pass
  - Make targets lint, format, typecheck are properly defined in Makefile
  - pyproject.toml already has correct tool configurations for black, ruff, mypy
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The project uses a layered requirements approach: requirements.txt (base), requirements-dev.txt (dev tools), requirements-pi.txt (Pi hardware)
  - pyproject.toml [project.optional-dependencies] section also defines dev dependencies for `pip install .[dev]`
  - Makefile install-dev should use requirements-dev.txt for single-command dev setup

- **Verification:**
  - All 1013 tests pass
  - Git working tree clean after commit
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The acceptance criteria files were already tracked in git - the "untracked documentation" refers to the ralph/archive directories
  - specs/glossary.md is a living document that grows as new features are added
  - Ralph archive directories contain valuable learnings that should be preserved for future iterations
  - The Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt consolidates reusable learnings from archived runs

## 2026-01-26 - US-TD-008
User Story: Add Backup Configuration Schema
- Added backup configuration defaults to config_validator.py DEFAULTS dict:
  - backup.enabled: False (backup disabled by default)
  - backup.provider: 'google_drive' (default to Google Drive via rclone)
  - backup.folderPath: 'OBD2_Backups' (default remote folder name)
  - backup.scheduleTime: '03:00' (default daily backup time)
  - backup.maxBackups: 30 (keep 30 daily backups = 1 month)
  - backup.compressBackups: True (compress backups to .gz)
  - backup.catchupDays: 2 (run catch-up backup if >2 days since last)
- Updated config.example.json with complete backup section
- Added 16 unit tests in TestBackupConfigDefaults class:
  - Tests for each default value being applied on empty config
  - Tests for custom values being preserved and not overwritten
  - Tests for partial config merging with defaults
- Files changed: src/common/config_validator.py, config.example.json, tests/test_config_validator.py, ralph/ralph_agents.json
- **Verification:**
  - All 1029 tests pass (16 new tests added)
  - Python syntax compilation passes
  - JSON syntax valid for config.example.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Config validator DEFAULTS uses dot-notation paths (e.g., 'backup.enabled') which auto-creates nested structure
  - Boolean defaults (True/False) must use Python booleans, not strings
  - Test pattern for config defaults: test both default application AND custom value preservation
  - config.example.json should document all configurable options with sensible defaults for user reference
