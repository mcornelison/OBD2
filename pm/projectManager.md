## Project Vision

The Eclipse OBD-II Performance Monitoring System is a **data collection and analysis platform** that ultimately feeds into ECU tuning decisions. The full workflow:

```
[Drive Vehicle] → [Collect OBD-II Data] → [Analyze with AI on Chi-Srv-01]
        ↓                                           ↓
[Store in SQLite] ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← [AI Recommendations]
        ↓
[CIO reviews data + recommendations]
        ↓
[Apply tuning changes via ECMLink V3]
        ↓
[Drive again → compare before/after]
```

### ECMLink V3 Context

The CIO plans to upgrade the Eclipse GST with a **programmable ECU** running **ECMLink V3** from [ECMTuning](https://www.ecmtuning.com/). ECMLink is the industry-standard tuning tool for 1990-1999 DSM (Diamond Star Motors) vehicles.

**What ECMLink does:**
- Direct access to fuel maps, timing maps, airflow tables, boost control
- Datalogging at 1000+ samples/sec (much faster than standard OBD-II)
- Speed density mode, GM MAF translation, dual-bank injector control
- Wideband O2 integration for real-time air-fuel ratio monitoring
- Excel-compatible data import/export (copy-paste)

**What THIS project provides to the ECMLink workflow:**
- Long-term OBD-II data collection across multiple drives
- Statistical analysis (max, min, avg, std dev, outliers) per parameter
- AI-powered recommendations for fuel map and timing adjustments
- Drive-by-drive comparison to track tuning impact
- Alert system for out-of-range values during drives
- Data export for offline analysis

**Key tuning parameters our system monitors:**
- Air-fuel ratio (critical for fuel map tuning)
- RPM and load (the X/Y axes of fuel and timing maps)
- Coolant temperature (affects fuel enrichment)
- Throttle position (load input)
- Boost pressure (turbo tuning)
- Intake air temperature (density correction)

**Current status**: ECMLink not yet installed. The Eclipse is on the stock ECU. Our system monitors via standard OBD-II now. When the programmable ECU is installed, the data we're already collecting will inform the initial tune, and ongoing monitoring will track the impact of tuning changes.

## PM Rules

1. **Marcus never writes code.** He creates, grooms, and revises user stories and PRDs.
2. **Input sources**: CIO direction, `pm/techDebt/`, `pm/issues/`, `pm/blockers/`, and project analysis.
3. **Marcus owns `specs/`** -- the core guidelines and principles developers follow.
4. **No duplicate information.** Each fact lives in exactly one document. Documents reference each other.
5. **Clear acceptance criteria** on every backlog item and user story. Assume working code, but the CIO must be able to validate input/output matches expectations.
6. **Validation scripts** are part of user stories when the developer doesn't have direct database access. The story specifies the test program to write for verifying data in/out.

## Naming Conventions

### Prefixes

| Prefix | Meaning | Owner | Detail Level |
|--------|---------|-------|--------------|
| **B-XXX** | Backlog item | Marcus (PM) | High-to-medium level. Gets groomed into a PRD. |
| **US-XXX** | User story | Developer/Ralph | Developer-ready. Lives inside PRDs and `stories.json`. |
| **I-XXX** | Issue | Anyone | Bug or defect discovered during development. |
| **BL-XXX** | Blocker | Marcus (PM) | Item preventing progress on work. |
| **TD-XXX** | Tech debt | Marcus (PM) | Known shortcut needing future remediation. |

### Backlog Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Identified but not yet detailed. Needs grooming before work can begin. |
| **Groomed** | Acceptance criteria written, validation requirements defined. Ready for PRD creation. |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked via a PRD and Ralph execution. |
| **Complete** | All acceptance criteria met, CIO has validated input/output. |

**Workflow**: `B-` items are groomed into PRDs containing `US-` stories. The PRD is converted to `ralph/stories.json` for autonomous execution.

## Session Handoff Checklist

When ending a session, update this section:

### Last Session Summary (2026-01-31, Session 4 - Pi Deployment + Ralph Queue)

**What was accomplished:**
- **Pi 5 deployment (B-012)**: CIO flashed OS, SSH key auth configured, pi_setup.sh run successfully, hardware verified (I2C, GPIO, platform detection all pass)
- **Pi debugging**: Discovered OSOYOO 3.5" display is HDMI (not SPI/GPIO) -- removed Adafruit deps from requirements-pi.txt, replaced Adafruit checks in check_platform.py with pygame check
- **Config path fix (I-005)**: main.py resolved config paths relative to CWD, broke systemd/remote execution. Fixed to resolve relative to script location using `Path(__file__).resolve().parent`. Updated tests to use `endswith()` assertions.
- **Git branch cleanup**: Config fix landed on wrong branch (`main`). Cherry-picked to `master`, pushed. `main` branch still exists and should be deleted.
- **Ralph queued**: Loaded stories.json with 9 stories across B-015 (Database Verify, 4 stories) and B-016 (Remote Ollama, 5 stories). TDD-ordered with test stories first. Committed and pushed.
- **B-013 confirmed complete**: All 7 US-DEP stories passed, 1133 tests passing

**Key learnings:**
- OSOYOO 3.5" HDMI display does NOT use GPIO/SPI -- Adafruit RGB display libs are irrelevant. Pygame renders to HDMI framebuffer directly.
- Config paths must be resolved relative to script location (`Path(__file__).resolve().parent`), not CWD, for systemd and remote SSH execution.
- `origin/HEAD` still points to `origin/main` -- GitHub default branch needs to be changed to `master` in repo settings.
- Pi username is `mcornelison` (not `pi`), path is `/home/mcornelison/Projects/EclipseTuner`
- `OBD_BT_MAC` env var warning is expected -- Bluetooth dongle not yet paired

**What's next:**
- Ralph: Execute 9 stories (B-015 + B-016) -- run `./ralph/ralph.sh 10`
- CIO: Delete `main` branch, set GitHub default to `master`
- CIO: Power up Chi-Srv-01 and provide specs
- Groom B-022 (companion service) and B-023 (WiFi-triggered sync) into PRDs
- B-024 (local Ollama cleanup) after B-016
- B-014 (Pi testing) blocked until B-012, B-013, B-015 done

**Unfinished work:**
- `main` branch needs to be deleted (local + remote + GitHub default changed)
- B-022 and B-023 need PRDs before Ralph can work them
- Chi-Srv-01 specs needed for B-022 PRD

**Questions for CIO:**
- **REMINDER**: Power up Chi-Srv-01 and provide exact specs (CPU, RAM, GPU model, disk capacity)
- **REMINDER**: When is the programmable ECU + ECMLink install planned?
- **ACTION**: Change GitHub default branch from `main` to `master`, then delete `main` branch

### Previous Session Summary (2026-01-31, Session 3 - PM Grooming)

**What was accomplished:**
- Groomed all Phase 5.5 (Pi Deployment) backlog items (B-012 through B-016)

  - `pm/prds/prd-pi-testing.md` (B-014, 4 user stories: US-PIT-001 through US-PIT-004)
- Groomed B-012 as CIO manual checklist (5 phases, references existing scripts)
- Reviewed B-013 PRD -- already solid, Ralph working (US-DEP-001 complete)
- Key code discovery: Ollama URL already config-driven, B-016 scope smaller than expected
- Key code discovery: Database `initialize()` already idempotent, B-015 wraps in CLI tool
- Updated roadmap: Phase 5.5 status from "Planned" to "Groomed", all backlog items updated
- B-020 and B-021 confirmed complete
- **CIO decisions recorded**:
  - Pi 5 hostname: **EclipseTuner**
  - LLM server: **Chi-srv-01** (local network, Ollama never on Pi)
  - Home WiFi: **DeathStarWiFi** (triggers sync/backup/AI)
  - Need companion service on Chi-srv-01 (B-022)
  - WiFi-triggered sync and AI workflow (B-023)
  - Clean up all local Ollama references (B-024)
- Created 3 new backlog items: B-022, B-023, B-024
- Updated B-012 hostname to EclipseTuner, WiFi to DeathStarWiFi
- Updated B-016 PRD with Chi-srv-01 references
- Updated `deploy/deploy.conf.example` default host to EclipseTuner.local
- Added Code Quality Rules to `ralph/agent.md` (reusable code, small files, organized structure)
- Added explicit "always report back" reminder to Ralph's PM Communication Protocol
- **Network infrastructure recorded**: chi-eclipse-tuner (10.27.27.28), Chi-Srv-01 (10.27.27.100), Chi-NAS-01 (10.27.27.121), DeathStarWiFi (10.27.27.0/24)

- Updated B-012 hostname to chi-eclipse-tuner, WiFi to DeathStarWiFi, IP to 10.27.27.28
- Updated deploy.conf.example with chi-eclipse-tuner.local
- Chi-NAS-01 added as secondary backup target in B-022, B-023
- **ECMLink V3 context captured**: Project's ultimate purpose is data collection → AI analysis → ECU tuning
- Created B-025 (ECMLink Data Integration, L) as Phase 6.5
- Added Project Vision section to projectManager.md with full ECMLink workflow
- Updated glossary: ECMLink V3, ECU, DSM, MAP acronyms
- Repo decision: **same repo** (monorepo) for companion service

**What's next:**
- Ralph: Complete B-013 (US-DEP-002 through US-DEP-007) -- in progress now
- CIO: Power up Chi-Srv-01 and provide exact specs
- CIO: Pi 5 initial setup (B-012 checklist -- when ready)
- Ralph: Pick up B-015 and B-016 (convert PRDs to stories.json)
- Groom B-022 (Chi-Srv-01 companion service) and B-023 (WiFi-triggered sync) into PRDs
- B-024 (local Ollama cleanup) after B-016
- B-014 blocked until B-012, B-013, B-015 done
- B-025 (ECMLink) is future -- after programmable ECU installed

**Unfinished work:**
- B-022 and B-023 need PRDs before Ralph can work them
- B-024 needs grooming (small, may not need a full PRD)
- Chi-Srv-01 specs needed for B-022 PRD

**Questions for CIO:**
- **REMINDER**: Power up Chi-Srv-01 and provide exact specs (CPU, RAM, GPU model, disk capacity). Needed for companion service PRD and Ollama model sizing.
- B-022: Same repo or separate for companion service? **CIO preference: same repo** (monorepo)
- B-025: When is the programmable ECU + ECMLink install planned? (Affects Phase 6.5 timing)
