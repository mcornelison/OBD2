## Description

Evaluate and clean up the 40+ `run_tests_*.py` files in the tests directory. These appear to be legacy scripts from before pytest was adopted. Standard `pytest tests/` works and is configured in `pyproject.toml`. Most of these scripts are likely redundant.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All `run_tests_*.py` files evaluated and documented
- [ ] Redundant scripts deleted
- [ ] Any useful functionality preserved in `conftest.py`, `pyproject.toml`, or `Makefile`
- [ ] `pytest tests/` still passes all tests
- [ ] Test coverage unchanged after cleanup

## Validation Script Requirements

- **Input**: Run `pytest tests/ --cov=src` before and after cleanup
- **Expected Output**: Same test count and coverage percentage
- **Test Program**: Not needed -- pytest output is sufficient

## Notes

Current state: 13 core test modules (`test_*.py`) + 40+ runner scripts (`run_tests_*.py`). Investigate whether any runners provide unique setup logic before deleting.
