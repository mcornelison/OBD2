## Description

Add support for the OSOYOO 3.5" HDMI capacitive touch screen (480x320) for the Raspberry Pi deployment. Currently the display system supports headless, minimal, developer, and adafruit modes. Need to add an `hdmi_touch` mode with full-screen dashboard and touch input.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] HDMI touch driver implemented at `src/display/drivers/hdmi_touch.py`
- [ ] 480x320 resolution rendering works
- [ ] Touch input handles tap gestures for buttons
- [ ] Full-screen dashboard displays RPM, temp, speed, and other gauges
- [ ] Profile switching works via touch
- [ ] Settings accessible via touch
- [ ] Works alongside existing display drivers (selected via config)
- [ ] `pygame` and optionally `evdev` added to `requirements-pi.txt`

## Validation Script Requirements

- **Input**: Set `display.mode` to `hdmi_touch` in config, start application
- **Expected Output**: Full-screen dashboard renders on HDMI display, touch events logged
- **Test Program**: Write tests with mocked pygame surface that verify layout rendering at 480x320, touch event handling, and mode switching. Must run headless (no actual display needed).

## Notes

UI must use large touch-friendly buttons, high contrast colors, no hover interactions. Refresh rate 1-2 Hz to reduce Pi CPU load. See `specs/samples/piSpecs.md` for hardware details.
