## Description

Refactor all Python code from camelCase naming convention to PEP 8 compliant snake_case for functions and variables. ~31,000 LOC across ~120+ Python files. Classes stay PascalCase, constants stay UPPER_SNAKE_CASE. Must be done module by module with full test suite passing after each module.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All Python functions use snake_case
- [ ] All Python variables use snake_case
- [ ] All tests pass after each module migration
- [ ] `specs/standards.md` updated to reflect snake_case convention
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` updated
- [ ] `ralph/agent.md` updated
- [ ] No camelCase functions/variables remain (except external library calls)

## Validation Script Requirements

- **Input**: Run `pytest tests/ --cov=src` after each module migration
- **Expected Output**: All tests pass, coverage unchanged
- **Database State**: No database changes
- **Test Program**: Write a grep-based lint script that detects remaining camelCase function definitions in `src/` (excluding external imports)

## Notes

This is an XL effort requiring a dedicated PRD with one user story per module. High risk of introducing bugs. Suggested order: `src/common/` first (smallest impact), `src/obd/` last (largest). Must update `specs/standards.md` after first module to establish the new convention.
