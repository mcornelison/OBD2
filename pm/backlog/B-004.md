## Description

Review commented-out dependencies in `requirements.txt` and determine which should be enabled. Development tools (`black`, `ruff`, `mypy`) are referenced in `CLAUDE.md` and `Makefile` but may be commented out. Decide on `requests` vs `urllib`, whether `pandas`/`numpy` are needed, and whether `sqlalchemy` adds value over raw SQLite.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All needed dependencies uncommented and installable
- [ ] Optional dependencies documented with rationale
- [ ] `make quality` commands work with dev dependencies installed
- [ ] Consider splitting into `requirements-dev.txt` for dev-only tools
- [ ] `pip install -r requirements.txt` succeeds cleanly

## Validation Script Requirements

- **Input**: Fresh virtual environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Expected Output**: All packages install without errors, `make lint`, `make format`, `make typecheck` all execute successfully
- **Test Program**: Not needed -- pip install output and make commands are sufficient

## Notes

Current code uses `urllib` to avoid HTTP library dependencies. If `requests` is added, consider migrating HTTP calls for consistency.
