## Description

The Raspberry Pi 5 with OSOYOO 3.5" HDMI touch screen is now available. No Geekworm X1209 UPS power unit yet (will run on standard power for now). Need to perform initial OS setup, configure SSH access, set up networking, and prepare the Pi as a deployment target.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) installed and booting
- [ ] SSH access configured and working from Windows dev machine
- [ ] WiFi or Ethernet networking configured
- [ ] HDMI touch screen displaying correctly
- [ ] Python 3.11+ installed and verified
- [ ] pip and venv available
- [ ] SQLite3 available (bundled with Python)
- [ ] Git installed (for CI/CD pipeline, see B-013)
- [ ] Hostname, timezone, and locale configured
- [ ] Documentation written: IP address, credentials (stored securely), access method

## Validation Script Requirements

- **Input**: SSH into Pi from Windows machine
- **Expected Output**: Login succeeds, `python3 --version` returns 3.11+, `sqlite3 --version` returns valid version, display is active
- **Test Program**: Write `scripts/verify_pi_setup.py` that checks Python version, SQLite version, disk space, network connectivity, and display status. Outputs pass/fail for each check.

## Notes

Power unit (Geekworm X1209 UPS HAT) is not yet available. The Pi will run on standard USB-C power. Power management features (B-007, orchestration shutdown stories) will be deferred until the UPS HAT arrives.
