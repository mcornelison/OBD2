## Description

77 commits on `master` are ahead of `origin/master`. This is a significant amount of unsynced work. Needs to be pushed before starting CI/CD setup (B-013) so the remote has the current codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All commits pushed to `origin/master`
- [ ] `git status` shows branch is up to date with remote
- [ ] No merge conflicts

## Validation Script Requirements

Not applicable -- git operation only.

## Notes

Must be completed before B-013 (CI/CD Pipeline) since the deployment script will pull from the remote. Developer flagged this in the housekeeping session.
