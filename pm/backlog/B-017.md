## Description

The developer has proposed three new coding rules that need to be added to `specs/standards.md`. These rules codify practices already in use and address the oversized file problem documented in TD-001.

### Rules to Add

1. **Write Reusable Code** -- Extract common logic into shared utilities; check existing helpers before writing new ones
2. **Keep Files Small** -- ~300 lines for source files, ~500 lines for test files; split when exceeding
3. **Organize by Functionality and Module** -- Follow the established package structure (types.py, exceptions.py, core modules, helpers.py, __init__.py)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All three rules added to `specs/standards.md` as a new section or appended to Section 4
- [ ] Each rule includes a brief rationale and the guideline thresholds (300/500 lines)
- [ ] Package structure pattern documented (types.py → exceptions.py → core → helpers.py → __init__.py)

## Validation Script Requirements

Not applicable -- documentation change only. Visual inspection of `specs/standards.md`.

## Notes

Filed by Ralph (Agent 1) via I-001. PM will make this change directly since `specs/` is PM-owned.
