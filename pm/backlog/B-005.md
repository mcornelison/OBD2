## Description

Review untracked documentation files and commit them to the repository. Several docs, scripts, PRDs, and archive files exist locally but are not tracked in git. Each file needs review to ensure it's complete, contains no sensitive information, and belongs in the repo.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All documentation files reviewed for completeness
- [ ] No sensitive data in committed files
- [ ] Appropriate files committed with descriptive message
- [ ] Ralph archives decision made (commit or .gitignore)
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated if needed

## Validation Script Requirements

- **Input**: Run `git status` before and after
- **Expected Output**: All reviewed files either committed or added to `.gitignore`
- **Test Program**: Not needed -- git status output is sufficient

## Notes

This should be re-evaluated after the pm/specs reorganization is complete, as file paths will have changed.
