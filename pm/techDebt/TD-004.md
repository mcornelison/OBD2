# TD-004: Config File Drift (Display Dimensions, Data Retention)

| Field        | Value                     |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Priority     | High                      |
| Status       | Open                      |
| Category     | infrastructure            |
| Affected     | `src/obd_config.json`     |
| Introduced   | Display change (hardware swap), US-TD-003 (code default changed but config not updated) |
| Created      | 2026-01-29                |
| Backlog Item | B-020                     |

## Description

Two config values in `src/obd_config.json` don't match reality:
- `display.width/height`: 240x240 should be 480x320 (OSOYOO hardware)
- `dataRetention.realtimeDataDays`: 7 should be 365 (US-TD-003 changed code default only)

## Why It Was Accepted

Hardware change was made at the architecture level but config file wasn't updated. Data retention default was changed in code but the config file was missed.

## Risk If Not Addressed

- Display will render at wrong dimensions on Pi 5
- Data retention will be 7 days instead of 365 if config file takes precedence over code defaults

## Remediation Plan

Tracked as B-020. Simple config file edit. Should be done before Pi deployment (B-012).
