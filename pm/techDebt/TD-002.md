| Affected     | Multiple files in `src/obd/` (original module locations that now re-export from subpackages) |
| Introduced   | 2026-01-22/23, module refactoring (Phase 4) |

## Description

During the Phase 4 module refactoring, monolithic modules were broken into subpackages. The original module files were kept as re-export facades for backward compatibility. For example, `src/obd/data_logger.py` now just imports and re-exports from `src/obd/data/`. These facades add unnecessary indirection.

## Why It Was Accepted

Maintaining backward compatibility during the refactoring allowed all 324 tests to pass without updating import paths. Breaking changes would have required updating every import across the codebase simultaneously.

## Risk If Not Addressed

- Extra import indirection (minor performance impact)
- Confusion about where code actually lives
- Two valid import paths for the same symbols
- Increases maintenance surface area

## Remediation Plan

Migrate all imports to use the new subpackage paths directly, then delete the facade files. Can be bundled with the snake_case migration (B-006) since that will touch every import anyway. Related backlog item: B-006.
