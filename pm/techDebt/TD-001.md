# TD-001: TestDataManager Pytest Collection Warning

| Field        | Value                     |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Priority     | Low                       |
| Status       | Open                      |
| Category     | testing                   |
| Affected     | `tests/test_utils.py` (TestDataManager class) |
| Introduced   | 2026-01-21, initial test framework setup |
| Created      | 2026-01-29                |

## Description

The `TestDataManager` class in `tests/test_utils.py` has an `__init__` constructor. Pytest attempts to collect it as a test class because of the `Test` prefix, then emits a warning because it can't instantiate it (due to the constructor arguments).

## Why It Was Accepted

The class provides useful test data management functionality. Renaming it would require updating all references.

## Risk If Not Addressed

- No functional risk -- tests still run and pass
- Minor noise in pytest output (warning message)
- Could mask other legitimate warnings

## Remediation Plan

Either rename the class to `DataManager` (drop `Test` prefix) or add `__test__ = False` class attribute to suppress collection. Low effort, can be bundled with any cleanup task.
