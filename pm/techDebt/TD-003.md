## Description

Files grew beyond manageable sizes during rapid feature development. The worst offender is `src/obd/orchestrator.py` at 2,500 lines (8x over the 300-line guideline). See `pm/techDebt/TD-001-large-files-and-empty-packages.md` for the full inventory.

## Why It Was Accepted

Speed of delivery during Phases 2-4 was prioritized over file size discipline. The file size coding rule (B-017) didn't exist until now.

## Risk If Not Addressed

- Ralph cannot effectively work on files this large (context window limits)
- Developer productivity degrades as files grow
- Merge conflicts increase with large files
- 3 empty placeholder packages suggest an abandoned refactoring

## Remediation Plan

Tracked as B-019. Will require a multi-story PRD to split systematically. Start with `orchestrator.py` since it's on the critical path.
