# Vehicle Knowledge Index — 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse GST

**Quick-reference index into the atomic vehicle cards in `cards/`.**

> This file is an **index, not a source of truth.** Authoritative facts about THIS specific car live in `cards/*.md` (one fact per card, SSOT). This index is intended to be **generated from card front-matter** (`id` / `title` / `ecu` / `status` / `summary`); it is hand-seeded today and will become a build artifact once the card migration completes.
>
> - **THIS-car facts** → `cards/` (indexed here).
> - **General 4G63 / DSM / tuning craft** (PID interpretation, knock theory, fuel-trim trees, failure modes, glossary, ECMLink capability reference) → stays in `knowledge.md`.
> - Card schema + conventions → `cards/README.md`.

## Live cards

| Card | ECU | Status | Summary |
|------|-----|--------|---------|
| [[ecu-prior-md346675]] | prior | current | 1998 factory FWD-turbo ECU; 100% stock, never flashed; flash-hardware but not ECMLink-flashable; drives ≤24 = stock baselines. |
| [[ecu-new-md326328]] | new | current | 1997 ECMLink-V3 board (mfr E2T61683), installed 2026-05-22; running prior-tuner ECMLink tune; Mode 09/22 silent; SPEED PID reads TRUE (factor 1.00, GPS-confirmed Drive 27 — old "2×" was a km/h/mph mislabel). |
| [[safe-range-coolant-temp]] | both | current | Normal 185–205°F; danger >220°F. Two-tier alert 210/220°F. Head-gasket risk. |
| [[safe-range-timing-knock]] | both | current | Timing danger <5°/negative; knock count >5/pull danger (ECMLink-only). 4500–5000 RPM knock window. |
| [[safe-range-fuel-trims]] | both | current | STFT danger >±15%, LTFT >±10%; O2 oscillates 0.1–0.9V @1–3Hz. This-car LTFT ~−6.25% normal. |
| [[safe-range-afr]] | both | current | (Wideband, future) WOT 11.0–11.8 normal, >12.5 LEAN danger; cruise 14.5–15.0; idle 14.7±0.3. |
| [[safe-range-boost]] | both | current | Stock TD04 boost 10–12 normal, >15 danger; injector duty >85% danger. Boost not OBD-readable (0x0B). |
| [[safe-range-battery-voltage]] | both | current | Running 13.5–14.5V normal; <12.0/>15.0V danger. Read via ELM ATRV, not a PID. |
| [[safe-range-engine-envelope]] | both | current | Redline 7000 RPM; load >90% danger; IAT >60°C heat-soak; MAF saturates ~150 g/s. |
| [[wheels-tires-potenza-205-55r16]] | both | current | Bridgestone Potenza 205/55R16 91H on aftermarket 16" 5-lug wheels; STOCK size → rolling circ ≈1.985 m, ~811 rev/mi; tires not a speed-cal factor (new-ECU "2× SPEED drift" disproven 2026-06-05 — PID reads TRUE, factor 1.00). Aged (made March 2003, DOT 1003, ~23 yr) but full tread + garaged + CIO-inspected no rot → CIO retaining; cleared for low-speed calibration drive. |
| [[drivetrain-f5m33-gear-ratios]] | both | current | Stock F5M33 5-speed (2G FWD turbo): 3.090/1.833/1.217/0.888/0.741, final 4.153. Cross-validated vs prior-ECU Drive 18. ~24 mph/1000rpm in 5th. |

## Planned cards (migration manifest)

The full set to extract from `knowledge.md` during the MrSpool RAG sprint. Each becomes one atomic card with front-matter. **ECU group seeded ✅; rest PLANNED.**

**ECU** — `ecu-prior-md346675` ✅ · `ecu-new-md326328` ✅ · `ecu-swap-2026-05-22` (event + install/removal timestamps + reason)

**Vehicle identity & mods** — `vehicle-identity` (VIN, 76k mi, 7-bolt, manual) · `wheels-tires-potenza-205-55r16` ✅ · `drivetrain-f5m33-gear-ratios` ✅ · `mods-installed` · `parts-in-hand` · `parts-to-order` · `summer-2026-install-plan` · `illinois-emissions`

**OBD capability (this car)** — `obd-supported-pids` (16 confirmed) · `obd-unsupported-pids` (0x0A/0x0B/0x42 + workarounds) · `battery-voltage-via-elm` (ATRV)

**Safe ranges (this car, by mod level)** ✅ — `safe-range-coolant-temp` ✅ · `safe-range-timing-knock` ✅ · `safe-range-fuel-trims` ✅ · `safe-range-afr` ✅ · `safe-range-boost` ✅ · `safe-range-battery-voltage` ✅ · `safe-range-engine-envelope` ✅

**Empirical drives** — `drive-005-cold-warm-baseline` · `drive-006-cold-start-city` · `drive-007-under-load-baseline` · `drive-011-knock-retard` *(archived-historical, prior ECU)* · `drive-026-newecu-first-knock` *(current, new-ECU working baseline)* · `session-023-first-light` *(archived-historical)* · `session-006-thermostat-drill`

**This-car systems** — `cooling-thermostat-behavior` (I-016 closed benign) · `fuel-system-stock-specs`

**Mod path & pre-wire** — `mod-priority-path` · `prewire-wideband-o2` · `prewire-e85-flex-fuel`

## Explicitly NOT carded (not vehicle tuning knowledge)

UPS HAT / drain-test / regression-fixture sections of `knowledge.md` are **infrastructure / dev artifacts**, not Eclipse tuning facts — excluded from the vehicle corpus (pending relocation decision; see `rag-readiness-assessment.md` §7).
